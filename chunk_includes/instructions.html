<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
<p>You will see a series of sentences. Your task is to indicate how natural these sentences sound to you. On the screen you will see a sentence with a scale underneath it. If you think that the sentence sounds perfectly natural you should give it a "5", if it is a bit odd give it a "4", and so on up to "1" which means that you think the sentence sounds very unnatural.</p>
<p>These instructions will be followed by two training sentences.</p>
